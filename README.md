# haunt.js

haunt.js is a JS based ambient sound generator for a haunted house! This project is being written for the Zappos.com 2014 Haunted House.

If you want to run this in offline mode (important - there is no wifi in the garage), you will need to clone the codebase:

	git clone https://github.com/makenai/haunt.js.git

Then you can use Python to host it locally so you don't have Cross-Site errors.

	cd haunt.js
	python -mSimpleHTTPServer

Just go to http://localhost:8000/!
